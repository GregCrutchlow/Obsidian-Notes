Had dinner with the Inkline team tonight, which was incredibly fun and filling. We went to the Shoreclub within the Westin hotel downtown (attached to the Rideau Centre) and it was incredibly good. I had brussel sprouts with fennel and asparagus. Erika had a mushroom ricotta ravioli that was very good as well. Both were very rich and filling.
