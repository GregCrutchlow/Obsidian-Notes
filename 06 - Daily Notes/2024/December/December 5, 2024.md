Little bit of an early start to this one, but I really wanted to get this in while it was still fresh. It's currently 12:30am as I write this, so bare with me as I try to keep a coherent thought process through all of this.

My friend Val, who plays Magic the Gathering with myself, Erika and Brian, asked me to 3D print a deck box for Brian for Christmas. She chose, of all things, a deck box that looks like a dumpster. I actually love it, and I'm sure that I'll be printing my own version of the deck box. I bought the files and printed out the lid for it already. I used some Matte PLA filament for the lid, which I think really matches real dumpster lids. They don't have a shiny finish like metal does, since most dumpster lids are made of plastic. I'll make the body of the deck box out of regular PLA I think, since it's more widely available, and the finish to it matches more closely to the real thing. 

One issue that has arisen with this print so far, is the size of the magnets used to keep the lid closed. No where in the file or the post for the print does it state the size of the magnets needed for the lid or body of the box. From my measurements, which aren't that accurate, since I don't have a caliper to measure, they seem to fit 5-6mm round magnets. I have no idea what the thickness would be, no more than 2mm. Hopefully that's the size, since 2mm thick magnets seem to be the most common to purchase.

The lid came out quite nice, the matte finish I think is a great fit for this box.
