Little bit of an early start to this one, but I really wanted to get this in while it was still fresh. It's currently 12:30am as I write this, so bare with me as I try to keep a coherent thought process through all of this.

My friend Val, who plays Magic the Gathering with myself, Erika and Brian, asked me to 3D print a deck box for Brian for Christmas. She chose, of all things, a deck box that looks like a dumpster. I actually love it, and I'm sure that I'll be printing my own version of the deck box. I bought the files and printed out the lid for it already. I used some Matte PLA filament for the lid, which I think really matches real dumpster lids. They don't have a shiny finish like metal does, since most dumpster lids are made of plastic. I'll make the body of the deck box out of regular PLA I think, since it's more widely available, and the finish to it matches more closely to the real thing. 

One issue that has arisen with this print so far, is the size of the magnets used to keep the lid closed. No where in the file or the post for the print does it state the size of the magnets needed for the lid or body of the box. From my measurements, which aren't that accurate, since I don't have a caliper to measure, they seem to fit 5-6mm round magnets. I have no idea what the thickness would be, no more than 2mm. Hopefully that's the size, since 2mm thick magnets seem to be the most common to purchase.

The lid came out quite nice, the matte finish I think is a great fit for this box.

Printed the rest of the box throughout the day today while I worked, and it came out beautifully. The corners of the main box lifted during the print (I don't know why). I showed it to Val, since she "hired" me to do the printing job. She loved how it turned out. I'm very excited for her to get it and eventually gift it to Brian. He'll love how dumb/awesome it is haha. The green filament I picked up today ended up being the perfect green for the dumpster look. Very happy about it.

I'm going to design, to my specifications, my own deck box. I'm doing it for my rat deck(s), and it's going to be modeled off a block of cheese. Something like Swiss, so it has holes and you can see the cards. I'm using the measurements from the box that Val hired me to print since it's dimensions are perfect for my deck sizes that are generally doubled sleeved.

I found out my Spotify Wrapped and my top artists/songs of the year were. Not surprisingly, Silent Planet was my #1 band to listen to as well as song, which was Antimatter. All the other suspects were there of course, including Knocked Loose. They started off in my ear, not too great, but they soon grew on me with their latest album. Went back into their discography and I have loved all of their stuff.
