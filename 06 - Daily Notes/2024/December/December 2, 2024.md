First Monday of the last month of the year.

I'm trying to get my notes buttoned up and to my liking with the folder structure and the functionality before I get it shared across all my machines. I've already been testing the functionality of that syncing aspect, so I have that worked, as long as I'm not constantly going back and forth between machines.

Boys went to school and daycare today while Erika and I worked. I didn't work that much today, as it was slower. I'm trying to finish off a project for work, Tradex, and I'm trying to stay on track for that. 50 Creative and the people at Tradex have been slow to get information for me to finish the site. I should be able to finish what we have available tomorrow, if not very close to finishing it.

This morning Brooks was in a grumpy mood, which I can understand, being the first day of the week after a weekend of fun, parades and parties. He yelled at me about a box that Holden had, which he asked for. I reminded Brooks that yelling at me, for telling him the truth of the situation, was unfair and mean of him. I don't want to upset him, but he's been reverting back into his old ways of if he doesn't get what he wants he lashes out. He's been getting more time with video games and I feel like we need to reduce those hours again.

He lashed out at me again tonight after picking them up from school. I told him the truth about plugging in the Christmas lights around the garage and that we didn't have the needed extension cord to plug them in. He yelled at me and I, yet again, reminded him that if he continues on that track of lashing out in that way, that maybe video games would be taken away again. Erika and I don't want to do that but it's getting hard again with all the yelling and shutting down.
