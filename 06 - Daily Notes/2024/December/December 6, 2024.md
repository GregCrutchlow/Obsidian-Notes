## Journal

Good morning.

I really need to start writing down my idea for a story based on the albums from Silent Planet. Not directly linking the lyrics of the music to the story, but the feeling and ideas that I got from those albums gave me an idea of a current/post apocalyptic world where a "Superbloom" event happened with plants retaking the world, driving humans below the surface, forcing the construction of cities underground.

The idea of the stories were to be told through the eyes of survivors of the Superbloom as well as the harsh conditions of life underground. Since only the world's most financially rich could afford comfortable living spaces within the very few cities, indebted servitude becomes rampant as those without the means of affording residence then work to maintain these new cities and serve those more fortunate than them.

Others rebel, fight those with money and the means of defending themselves as well as explore the old world where conditions are harsh, inhospitable and often deadly as plant life has evolved to defend itself and prey upon "lesser" beings, humans no longer being at the top of the food chain. Even animals have evolved rapidly, not only to grow monstrously large, but to become apex predators. Even formerly gentle creatures are now deadly and seek out prey.  

Ya, I have to start writing this down and getting ideas out.
