## Journal
***
I do not feel well today. I've been tired/exhausted all day. I couldn't wake up at any point and I felt just run down all day. I've been getting sore all over my body, just overall a bad feeling to have.

We still got a lot done today, Erika doing the brunt of the work as I did the shopping for groceries as well as other small errands. I was able to buy/pick up another little gift for her for Christmas which was really nice. I got her [Ajani, Nacatl Pariah] in foil. I really hope she likes it. She better considering she asked for it haha.

I'm also giving her another card [Skyknight Squire|fdn|448] which is in a customed 3D frame for it. I don't expect it to stay in there, I think she would want to play that card within her [Rin and Seri, Inseparable] cat/dog deck. I liked her deck so much I wanted to make my own version of it. She did a great job with it considering it was her first deck she built. Her second deck, Humans and Cats [Trynn, Champion of Freedom] and [Sylvar, Devourer of the Free]. It's a very strong deck, which is hard to stop once it starts going.

Erika and I got high again tonight, and I want her so much, despite how I feel (run down). I may try.
