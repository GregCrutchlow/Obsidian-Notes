[[December 2, 2024]]

It's been an odd day today. The weather isn't the best, it's cold and gloomy outside. News from around the world has been, honestly, [shit](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-korea-martial-law-1.7399501).

I'm trying to get better at touch typing, but I'm trying to break decades old habits of just using two fingers on my right hand. I'm  also trying to do it while learning new keybinds on my keyboard, with my second shift bar being a modifier key and my caps lock being a backspace key.

I'm really enjoying my time within Obsidian though. I "yelled" out my praises for the app on Bluesky earlier today. 

I'm currently 3D printing a planter, which I plan on giving to Erika once it's done, if she likes it. I'm using PETG filament since it is 100% waterproof. I'll leave a picture once it's done printing.

Getting back into using Git has been a lot of fun and easier this time around I've found. I know what to look for for documentation on solving issues that I'm having as well as setting it properly (and keeping notes on how to as well).

I've been getting more and more into [[TTRPGs to Try|TTRPGs]]. The idea of trying one, solo, sounds super appealing to me. Stepping away from the computer sounds more exciting than me hoping to have the energy to play video games after the kids go to bed. I don't really know why but I really like the idea of being more analog than digital, rolling dice and writing things down with pen and paper. It just sounds so therapeutic. 

Imagine, being in the basement, alone, in the dark, rolling dice and trying to tell a story, to myself, without even knowing how it'll turn out.
