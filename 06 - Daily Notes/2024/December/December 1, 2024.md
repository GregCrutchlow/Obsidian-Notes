Daily was a bit of an interesting day again.

I've started to learn a new program more with plugins, the current one I'm writing in, Obsidian. I've installed a new plugin, Templater, which allows for templating notes if I write them consistently. It makes it so I don't have to do repetitive tasks like naming conventions, adding dates and headings. 

I've templatized my daily notes allowing me to get the ideas out of my head faster without thinking about it too much.

I'm also trying to learn new keybinds for my keyboard, potentially getting me to type faster and having to not move my hand as much and keeping them on the home row more.

Erika and I got high again before playing some Magic, doing JumpStart tonight. It's a fun format, 40 card, which you build a deck by choosing two "booster" packs which make up your deck. 

Erika and I played two games, each once with both decks, and she handily kicked my ass. It was a complete blowout. There were times where we both thought I was making a comeback before she would just immediately take it away. I had a wonderful time.

I'm currently fighting off the munchies.

As to why the day was interesting. It was a easier day, but I woke up early as James has gotten used to the 6:30am wake up time during the week. I was up then, and just in a naturally grumpy mood, and everyone, as they woke seemed to be grumpy as well. That lasted throughout the day until dinner time. All of us felt grumpy at one point or another oddly enough.

I've been enjoying this writing again and I will say leaning Obsidian is quite fun, uncovering more and more to what this program can do.
