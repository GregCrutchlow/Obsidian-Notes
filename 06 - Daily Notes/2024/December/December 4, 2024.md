Start of the day was good, slow, but good. The boys were in a good mood and everything went smoothly. Got out of the house a little bit later than expected, but nothing really hung us up.

Started to snow today, a decent amount of snow which should accumulate to a decent amount, but will probably be melted away later this week unfortunately.

Printing a phone stand for my phone for my desk. I'll most likely be printing cable management things for my desk as it's a complete disaster currently. I'm also printing more hooks for Christmas lights (C9 size) to try and attach more lights to the second story of our house, which is something I've always wanted to do.

I've been playing [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) for a few weeks now off and on, and it's just a great *simple* game. I've also been watching a streamer by the name of [Roffle](https://www.youtube.com/@RoffleLite) playing the game. I've learned quite a bit from his play throughs of the game.

I played a few games today, and I didn't fare that well. I won one game, unlocking a new deck, but I think I played close to 10 games, losing very early on in the games. Mostly from bad decisions I made early on. I'm trying to hard to go into multiple directions and not planning for boss blinds that I can see coming up. I just end up not paying attention to what the boss blind is, or just building a deck directly into what it stops.

I'm trying to decide if I want to use this app to keep track of my [[Built Decks]] or not. It seems like it would take awhile to upload everything here, potentially. Maybe I can just put in a list, and add tags to quickly find if decks need upgrades or not. I'll see what I can do and if I like to process at all.

Going back to 3D printing. I printed some Christmas light clips for the shingles on the second floor roof. Hopefully they work so I can print more and attach that second string of lights we bought. I've always wanted to do that.

Erika is tired this evening. The kids really hit her hard with the questions when they get home. All of them fight for her attention, and it takes a toll on her.

We got to enjoy some time together today after lunch, having a shower together, then being intimate with each other. Having to kick out Oscar, he has such a sweet face but he looked so hurt when I picked him up to move him out of our room. Poor guy just wanted to nap and relax.

Snowed a fair amount so far today, supposed to snow more over night. We'll see what it's like in the morning. I'll most likely have to shovel our driveway. The roads were quite slick today, the van slide a few times taking the boys to swimming.

It was a good day.
