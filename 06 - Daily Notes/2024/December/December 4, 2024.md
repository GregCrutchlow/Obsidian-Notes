[[December 3, 2024]]

Start of the day was good, slow, but good. The boys were in a good mood and everything went smoothly. Got out of the house a little bit later than expected, but nothing really hung us up.

Started to snow today, a decent amount of snow which should accumulate to a decent amount, but will probably be melted away later this week unfortunately.

Printing a phone stand for my phone for my desk. I'll most likely be printing cable management things for my desk as it's a complete disaster currently. I'm also printing more hooks for Christmas lights (C9 size) to try and attach more lights to the second story of our house, which is something I've always wanted to do.

I've been playing [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) for a few weeks now off and on, and it's just a great *simple* game. I've also been watching a streamer by the name of [Roffle](https://www.youtube.com/@RoffleLite) playing the game. I've learned quite a bit from his play throughs of the game.
