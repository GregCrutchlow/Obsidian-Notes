#### WUBRG
These decks contain every colour within magic, [[White]](W), [[Blue]](U), [[Black]](B), [[Red]](R) and [[Green]](G). 


#### Colourless
These decks solely function on cards that contain no colour themselves but may use coloured pips for casting costs. 
A truly colourless deck with no coloured lands, even basic, is incredibly hard to pull off, let alone win with it, in my humbled opinion.
