### Reflections

Today was a good day, despite some downsides. Nothing bad actually happened, just unfortunate happenstances. Spent time with the boys today at a holiday parade. Was fun, but it was terribly cold for how cold it was since were were standing stationary for over an hour. 

The parade itself wasn't bad, but since it's run by sponsors and volunteers, it was mostly a walking rotating billboard of advertisements. The kids enjoyed the characters and the free candy though, so that's something.

Erika had time with the kids and other parents at a kid's party this afternoon. James and I spent time going to a few stores, one of which was closed. It was a good time with him though and allowed him to nap in the van, which helped later night.

We also smoked again. I'm feeling it right now as I write this. I enjoyed doing it, the feeling I get and the sense of calm is always welcome. I dislike the fact how much we have been doing it, and I don't want it to become a crutch for me to sleep or to have a feeling of "ok". 

I enjoy it, but I don't want to become dependent on it. I also find myself going back to my office more when high instead of spending time with Erika. She tends to want to "veg" out more when in this state, but I do love spending time with her, amongst other things.

I love my life, and my family.

I love her.
