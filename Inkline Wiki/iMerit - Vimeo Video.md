3. Vimeo - Within Team Library > {website} >  video file links > choose appropriate video size link.
4. Elementor - paste video link within "video link" of widget. Within the link of the vimeo link, you must place the domain with "/mp4/" at the beginning of the link. For example previously it would be "https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/download/1021857947/rendition/1080p/homepage-element_2%20%281080p%29.mp4?loc=external&signature=cbf338836c0cec8ab3441a1a216ba1c34b98ea3e1bce6e8248645516af65a981" then you would replace "https://player.vimeo.com" with the domain you're working with and place "/mp4/ before the rest of the link which starts with "progressive. It will look like this at the end: "https://imerit.net/mp4/progressive_redirect/playback/1021857947/rendition/720p/file.mp4?loc=external&log_user=0&signature=f1b14ef3cd59ea6ad580c72e5891dc05ef7dfbe41a7c573e94fefe682692fccc".
