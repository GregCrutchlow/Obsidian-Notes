Currently all Calendars (within "Meeting Details") have "Zoom" and "Phone (Please call me at the number provided above.)" set for locations and "Scheherazade Mason" set for the Team Member.

For Automations, there is a Workflow within "Website CTA Book a Call" name "Website CTA Strategy Call - Workflow" that is triggered when a customer books an appointment through the "Free 30 minute strategy call" calendar CTA. This workflow will wait until 1 day before the scheduled meeting to send out an email (Templated email, mentioned later), and then send another templated email 1 hour before the meeting with details including rescheduling and cancellation links. 

Within the email templates "Website CTA Strategy Call Templates", there are links for rescheduling and cancellation, but nothing that provides Zoom links for the meeting itself currently.
