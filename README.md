# Obsidian-Sync
 
This is my personal Obsidian repository for my notes. With this, this will allow for me to sync and maintain my notes across multiple machines and operating systems. 

This is using Git and it's normal workflows currently to maintain backups to Github.

#### Plans for future

Adding scripting to allow for pulls on startup to stay in sync with Github automatically.
